          About the website</h2>
        <p>The site was created by and is currently maintained by BetaOS/betatester1024. 
        Back-end is run using Node.js and is hosted on <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>. 
        Both front- and back-end are written in pure TypeScript, HTML and CSS. <br>
        The website is also handled in the back-end using an 
        <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express server</a>.
          Source-code can be found 
          <a href="https://https://replit.com/@betatester1024/betatester1024">here</a> or

          User Security</h2>
        <p>User accounts are sent securely via HTTPS POST requests to the server, and stored in 
        a MongoDB database. Some data, such as word-lists, are stored publicly on <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a>. 
        <br>
        Usernames and some data is stored on MongoDB, but passwords are hashed and 
        salted using bcrypt before storing to the database. Sessions expire after sixty minutes 
        (one minute for super-administrators) and all tokens are validated server-side.
        <br>
        Administrators cannot access user data, they may only modify user account passwords 
        and create new accounts. Please <a href="/contact">contact BetaOS</a> to request account
        recovery, deletion or modification. 
        <br>
        We also log a user-token every time a user logs in, generated securely using 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto">window.crypto</a>.
        <br> We take user security very seriously and will work to fix all bugs as soon as possible. 
          Please submit a bug report if you find any vulnerabilities or would like more features!

          About BetaUtilities</h2>
        <p>
          BetaUtilities is a bot that connects to the online discussion site 
          <a href="https://euphoria.io">Euphoria</a>'s "rooms". It automatically responds
          to commands such as <kbd>!help</kbd> and provides a variety of features:<br>
          (The bot sometimes appears as a different username according to the room 
          it is currently in.)<br>
          <kbd>!ping</kbd>/<kbd>!ping @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Checks if BetaUtilities is online. <br>
          <kbd>!help @BetaUtilities</kbd>/<kbd>!contact @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Displays a telephone-button style menu for accessing 
          almost all features in the bot. Enter numbers, the english form of the letter or the emoji
          :short-code: for the choice you would like to make to interact with the menu. Call ends 
          after around 30 seconds.<br>
          <kbd>!kill @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Disconnects BetaUtilities from the room. <br>
          <kbd>!pause @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Deactivates BetaUtilities without disconnecting it from
          the current room. BetaUtilities will no longer respond to your commands until you run:<br>
          <kbd>!restore @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Re-activates BetaUtilities. <br>
          <kbd>!uptime @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Displays how long the current instance has been up. <br>
          <kbd>!wordle</kbd> - Plays wordle with you! BetaUtilities comes with a built-in word-list so
          you can't just enter sequences of five letters. <br>
          <kbd>!leetlen't</kbd> - Plays a BetaOS version of <a href="https://leet.nu/leetle">Leetle</a>
          with you - it works the same as Wordle but you can enter any sequences of 5 alphanumeric
          characters.<br>
          <kbd>!unblock [link]</kbd> - Sends your link through a proxy to un-block it for school networks. <br>
          <kbd>!src @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Sends you a link to the source-code. <br>
          <kbd>!runStats @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Shows you statistics on how many times BetaUtilities has been run,
          and how many times it has been @-mentionned. <br>
          <kbd>!creatorInfo</kbd>,<kbd>!version</kbd> - Pretty self-explanatory. <br>
          <kbd>!status @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Sends this site to the room.<br>
          <kbd>!activeRooms @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Shows all the rooms BetaUtilities is active in. <br>
          <kbd>!mitoseTo &[ROOM] as @[NAME]</kbd> - Sends BetaUtilities to a new room as another username.<br>
          <kbd>!rating @BetaUtilities</kbd> - Accesses the current call satisfaction rating for BetaUtilities.
          You can rate us by using the help-menu.<br>
          <kbd>!work</kbd>/<kbd>!work @user</kbd>/<kbd>!sleep</kbd>/<kbd>!sleep @user</kbd> - 
          Screams at you or any user to GO TO SLEEP or GET TO WORK.<br>
          <kbd>!wake</kbd>/<kbd>!wake @user</kbd>/<kbd>!play</kbd>/<kbd>!play @user</kbd> - 
          Stops screaming at you or any user. <br>
          <kbd>!antispam</kbd> - Configures AntiSpam activation. Requires a code entry.<br>
          <b>Some features are hidden! <a href="/contact">ask BetaOS</a> about them, or find
          us in <a href="https://euphoria.io/room/xkcd">&xkcd</a> to ask about the features!</b>
        </p>
        <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">speed</span>
          AntiSpam Feature</h2><p>
          BetaUtilities detects automatically when it has been triggered too many times in 5 minutes
          (usually 5 messages) and alerts the user. It is automatically paused
          after 10 messages have been sent in 5 minutes, unless the <kbd>!antispam</kbd> command has been used 
          and AntiSpam has been disabled. This feature is both in BetaUtilities on Euphoria and 
          BetaOS Systems ONLINE.
        </p>
        <h2><span class="material-symbols-outlined">hub</span>
          BetaOS Systems ONLINE</h2><p>
            <a href="signup">Sign-up</a> and <a href="login">login</a> 
            are pretty self-explanatory. Visit the <a href="admin">config</a>
            page to modify your password, or as an administrator,
            manage other accounts. Super-administrators can run code using
            the commands box.<br>
            The <a href="support">Support system</a> works the same as BetaUtilities 
            on Euphoria.<br>
            Enter <kbd>!renick @[NEWUSERNAME]</kbd> to rename yourself.
            The <a href="syslog">SysLog</a> can only be accessed by administrators, 
            and the <a href="status">status-page</a> alerts you when BetaUtilities 
            is down.
